### Key Concepts:
-   AI, ML and DL
-   model
-   tabular data
-   decision tree
-   ensemble
-   model metrics - accuracy, f1, etc...
-   data pre proccesing

    
### Final Exercise:
Do you like avocados? you have to! in this exercise you will create a model that will try to predict avocado prices.
You can find the dataset in this folder. Try use everything you have learnd to make the most accurate model you can!
