# Machine Learning
##### ETC: 10 days
I hope you like buzzwords because this is the hottest field in the hi tech industry this days.
This section is a small introduction for an unbelievably huge field, so it is extremely recommended to
read more of this subject.

### Key Concepts:
-   AI, ML and DL
-   model
-   supervised and unsupervised learning
-   problem types - regression, classification, clusterization, anomaly detection.
-   tabular data
-   linear regression
-   decision tree
-   neural network
-   CNN
-   ensemble
-   model metrics - accuracy, f1, etc...
-   data pre processing

### Final Exercise:
Do you like avocados? you must! in this exercise you will create a model that will try to predict avocado prices.
You can find the dataset in this folder. Try use everything you have learned to make the most accurate model you can!
